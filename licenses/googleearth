Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service

   Last Modified: July, 2022

   To use Google Maps/Google Earth, you must accept (1) the [9]Google
   Terms of Service, and (2) these Google Maps/Google Earth Additional
   Terms of Service (the “Maps/Earth Additional Terms”). The Maps/Earth
   Additional Terms incorporate by reference the [10]Legal Notices for
   Google Maps/Google Earth and Google Maps/Google Earth APIs.

   Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these
   documents are known as the “Terms”. They establish what you can expect
   from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.

   If you use the merchant-only features in Google Maps to manage your
   Business Profile then the Google Business Profile Terms at
   [11]https://support.google.com/business/answer/9292476 apply to that
   use.

   Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read
   [12]our Privacy Policy to better understand how you can [13]update,
   manage, export, and delete your information.
    1. License. As long as you follow these Terms, the [14]Google Terms of
       Service give you a license to use Google Maps/Google Earth,
       including features that allow you to:
         1. view and annotate maps;
         2. create KML files and map layers; and
         3. publicly display content with proper attribution online, in
            video, and in print.
       For more details about specific things that you’re permitted to do
       with Google Maps/Google Earth, please see the [15]Using Google
       Maps, Google Earth, and Street View permissions page.
    2. Prohibited Conduct. Your compliance with this Section 2 is a
       condition of your license to use Google Maps/Google Earth. When
       using Google Maps/Google Earth, you may not (or allow those acting
       on your behalf to):
         1. redistribute or sell any part of Google Maps/Google Earth or
            create a new product or service based on Google Maps/Google
            Earth (unless you use the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs in
            accordance with their [16]terms of service);
         2. copy the content (unless you are otherwise permitted to do so
            by the [17]Using Google Maps, Google Earth, and Street View
            permissions page or applicable intellectual property law,
            including "fair use");
         3. mass download or create bulk feeds of the content (or let
            anyone else do so);
         4. use Google Maps/Google Earth to create or augment any other
            mapping-related dataset (including a mapping or navigation
            dataset, business listings database, mailing list, or
            telemarketing list) for use in a service that is a substitute
            for, or a substantially similar service to, Google Maps/Google
            Earth; or
         5. use any part of Google Maps/Google Earth with other people's
            products or services for or in connection with real-time
            navigation or autonomous vehicle control, except through a
            specific Google-provided feature such as Android Auto.
    3. Actual Conditions; Assumption of Risk. When you use Google
       Maps/Google Earth's map data, traffic, directions, and other
       content, you may find that actual conditions differ from the map
       results and content, so exercise your independent judgment and use
       Google Maps/Google Earth at your own risk. You’re responsible at
       all times for your conduct and its consequences.
    4. Your Content in Google Maps/Google Earth. Content you upload,
       submit, store, send, or receive through Google Maps/Google Earth is
       subject to Google’s [18]Terms of Service, including the license in
       the section called [19]“Permission to use your content”. If you are
       a resident of France, the [20]Google Search Additional Terms of
       Service apply to such content which is made publicly available on
       Google Search. However, content that remains exclusively local to
       your device (such as a locally-stored KML file) is not uploaded or
       submitted to Google, and is therefore not subject to that license.
    5. Government Users. If you’re using Google Maps/Google Earth on
       behalf of a government entity, the following terms apply:
         1. Governing Law.
              i. For city or state government entities in the United
                 States and European Union, the Google Terms of Service
                 section regarding governing law and venue will not apply.
             ii. For United States federal government entities, the Google
                 Terms of Service section regarding governing law and
                 venue is replaced with the following:
                 “These Terms will be governed by and interpreted and
                 enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States
                 of America without reference to conflict of laws. Solely
                 to the extent permitted by federal law: (A) the laws of
                 the State of California (excluding California’s conflict
                 of laws rules) will apply in the absence of applicable
                 federal law; and (B) any dispute arising out of or
                 relating to these Terms or Google Maps/Google Earth will
                 be litigated exclusively in the federal courts of Santa
                 Clara County, California, and the parties consent to
                 personal jurisdiction in those courts.”
         2. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. All access or use of Google
            Maps/Google Earth by or for the United States federal
            government is subject to the "U.S. Government Restricted
            Rights" section in the [21]Google Maps/Google Earth Legal
            Notices.
